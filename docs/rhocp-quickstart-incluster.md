## Quick Start Guide with Redhat OCP 4.16 and LoxiLB in-cluster mode

This guide will explain how to:

* Deploy a single-node Redhat OCP 4.16 cluster
* Run loxilb in-cluster mode
* Expose services with loxilb as provider of serviceLB   

### Pre-requisite

* Single node to run Redhat OCP 4.16 (or later)
* Bastion or Host node to consume the services running in same network subnet as OCP node

### Topology   

For quickly bringing up loxilb with OCP, we will be deploying all components in a single node :

All components of loxilb run as part of the OCP cluster in this scenario. loxilb can be used with various [HA](https://docs.loxilb.io/latest/ha-deploy/) options as well, but skipped here for simplicity.   

## Setup Redhat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)  4.16

Users can follow the official [documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.16/html/installing/installing-on-a-single-node#preparing-to-install-snol) to install a single node OCP cluster

### Deploying loxilb in OCP

Use the following command to get the loxilb manifest:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loxilb-io/kube-loxilb/refs/heads/main/manifest/in-cluster/loxilb-nobgp.yaml
```

Change the contents of loxilb.yaml as following:
```
command: [ "/root/loxilb-io/loxilb/loxilb", "--egr-hooks", "--whitelist=enp0s3" ]
```
As one could guess, this is the name of system interface. This should be the interface which is associated with br-ex of OCP node. To confirm one can open the OCP web console and check under "Networking->NodeNetworkState" :

Now apply the loxilb manifest file :
```
oc apply -f loxilb-nobgp.yaml
```

The description of important loxilb args in the manifest file are as follows -    
```
--bgp : Indicates that loxilb will be running with bgp instance and will be advertising the service IP to the external peer or loxilb-peer.
--egr-hooks: It is required for those cases in which workloads can be scheduled in the same nodes as loxilb nodes (most of the cases).
--blacklist=cni[0-9a-z]|veth.|flannel.|cali.|tunl.|vxlan[.]calico: It is mandatory for running in in-cluster mode. As loxilb attaches it's ebpf programs on all the interfaces but since we running it in the default namespace then all the interfaces including CNI interfaces will be exposed and loxilb will attach it's ebpf program in those interfaces which is definitely not desired. So, user needs to mention a regex for  excluding all those interfaces.
--fallback: It is an optional argument and ensures that egress traffic from the cluster to the internet or external destinations defaults to system masquerade rules if no other rules apply. LoxiLB can also be used as a HA capable egress on its own.
```

### Deploying kube-loxilb in OCP
[kube-loxilb](https://github.com/loxilb-io/kube-loxilb) is used as loxilb's operator with Kubernetes. Get the manifest file :
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loxilb-io/kube-loxilb/refs/heads/main/manifest/in-cluster/kube-loxilb.yaml
```

Change the contents of kube-loxilb.yaml "args" to the following (leaving others commented) : 
```
        args:
          #- --loxiURL=http://192.168.80.10:11111
          - --cidrPools=defaultPool=192.168.80.100/32
          - --setRoles=0.0.0.0
          #- --setBGP=64512
          #- --listenBGPPort=1791
          #- --monitor
          #- --extBGPPeers=50.50.50.1:65101,51.51.51.1:65102
          #- --setLBMode=1
```
The CIDR is set to any unused IP/subnet in the local network.

Apply the yaml contents :
```
oc apply -f kube-loxilb.yaml
```

## Spawn a test pod and create a LB service
```
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service

  loadBalancerClass: loxilb.io/loxilb
  selector:

## Check the status
### Check Kubernetes services status :
```
$ oc get svc
NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP          PORT(S)           AGE
kubernetes      ClusterIP      10.245.0.1    <none>               443/TCP           31m
tcp-lb-onearm   LoadBalancer   10.245.2.83   llb-192.168.80.100   55002:32057/TCP   45s
```
### Check create LB rules in loxilb pod :
```
$ oc get pods -A |grep loxilb-lb
kube-system    loxilb-lb-sws2g                  1/1     Running   0          4m14s

$ oc exec -it -n kube-system loxilb-lb-sws2g  -- loxicmd get lb -o wide
|     EXT IP     | SEC IPS | HOST | PORT  | PROTO |         NAME          | MARK | SEL |  MODE  |    ENDPOINT    | EPORT | WEIGHT | STATE  | COUNTERS |
|----------------|---------|------|-------|-------|-----------------------|------|-----|--------|----------------|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| 192.168.80.100 |         |      | 55002 | tcp   | default_tcp-lb-onearm |    0 | rr  | onearm | 192.168.80.250 | 31640 |      1 | active | 11:818   |
```

## Connect from host/client
```
$ curl http://192.168.80.100:55002
